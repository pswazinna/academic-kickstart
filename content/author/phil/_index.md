Ever since I went to UPenn as an exchange student in 2015, I have been fascinated by different AI topics. I wrote my Bachelor's Thesis about statistically modeling attention on scientific publications and my Master's Thesis on using CNNs to classify various neurodegenerative diseases in MRI scans with weak supervision. In my PhD, I have shifted focus again, and developed multiple algorithms for model-based offline reinforcement learning, which is a topic I remain passionate about.
