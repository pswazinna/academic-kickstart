Ever since I went to the University of Pennsylvania as an exchange student in 2015, I have been fascinated by artificial intelligence topics, specifically machine learning. Upon return, I wrote my Bachelor's Thesis about statistically modeling attention on scientific publications using models that are normally employed to model the spread of diseases. I further switched to the Technical University of Munich for my Master's Degree in order to be able to focus more on machine learning. I took numerous related courses and also wrote my Master's Thesis on the topic: Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, I was able to recognize various neurodegenerative diseases in MRI scans of patients. In Munich I was also a working student at the Siemens learning systems group, where I was involved in developing Deep Learning models for Medical Image Classification.
